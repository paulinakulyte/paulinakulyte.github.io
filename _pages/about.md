Hi, I am a ML Research Engineer at [Absci](https://www.absci.com/) in Zurich, Switzerland, working on generative models for antibody design.

I hold a Master's degree in Advanced Computer Science from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). For my Master's thesis, I worked on diffusion models for antibody design, advised by [Professor Pietro Liò](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4YhNJBEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Professor José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BEBccCQAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my Master's, I was a Software Engineer at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/).

An up-to-date list of my publications is available below and on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=izbFB5YAAAAJ&hl=en).
